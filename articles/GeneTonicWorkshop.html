<a href="#using-alternative-enrichment-analysis-methods" class="anchor"></a>Using alternative enrichment analysis methods</h3>
<p>It is possible to use the output of different other methods for enrichment analysis, thanks to the <code>shaker_*</code> functions implemented in <code>GeneTonic</code> - see for example <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/GeneTonic/man/shake_topGOtableResult.html">?shake_topGOtableResult</a></code>, and navigate to the manual pages for the other functions listed in the “See Also” section.</p>
<p><code>GeneTonic</code> is able to convert for you the output of</p>
<ul>
<li>DAVID (text file, downloaded from the DAVID website)</li>
<li>clusterProfiler (takes <code>enrichResult</code> objects)</li>
<li>enrichr (a data.frame with the output of <code>enrichr</code>, or the text file exported from Enrichr)</li>
<li>fgsea (the output of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/fgsea/man/fgsea.html">fgsea()</a></code> function)</li>
<li>g:Profiler (the text file output as exported from g:Profiler, or a data.frame with the output of <code>gost()</code> in <code>gprofiler2</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples on how to use them are reported here:</p>

<p>The exploration can be guided by launching the introductory tours for each section of the app, and finally one can generate a small report focused on the features and genesets of interest.</p>

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#exploring-the-genetonic-app" class="anchor"></a>Exploring the <code>GeneTonic</code> app</h2>
<p>The <code>GeneTonic</code> app provides various different panels and plots to visualize your data. When launching the app as shown above, the <code>GeneTonic</code> app will start and show information about the provided data in the Welcome panel.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/welcome.png" alt=""><p class="caption">GeneTonic Welcome panel</p>
</div>
<p>The panel list the individual inputs of the <code>GeneTonic</code> app with some overall information (e.g. the number of DE genes). Further information about the input can be acquired by clicking the plus sign of each respective input.</p>
<p>Via the panel selection on the left side, individual panels can be explored. One of these panels is the Gene-Geneset panel which provides information about the genesets and genes found in the data based on the functional annotation object. The genesets and their belonging genes are depicted in a graph in which the genesets are shown as yellow rectangles and the genes as round nodes. The node color of the genes reflects their regulation in the data with red indicating an up-regulation and blue a down-regulation.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/gene_geneset_panel.png" alt=""><p class="caption">Gene-Geneset panel</p>
</div>
<p>Each panel offers a variety of different possibilities and options to explore the data. In order to familiarize with these options, each panel has a guided tour which highlights and explains the different possibilities. The tour can be started by clicking on the question mark button (in the image above this the button can be found above the Geneset box). The button activates the tour which will open as a small window on the screen.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/tour_start.png" alt=""><p class="caption">Start of the tour</p>
</div>
<p>The “Next” and “Back” button lead through the tour and its individual elements. Throughout the tour individual elements of the respective panel will be highlighted and explained.</p>
<p><img src="images/tour_explanation.png" alt="Example explanation of the tour"> The panels of the <code>GeneTonic</code> app are designed interactively and offer the possibility of exploring the data by clicking on various elements of the page. For example through clicking on one of the genesets in the shown graph (yellow rectangle) additional content will be displayed in the Geneset box. In the case of a geneset these are a heatmap and a volcano plot which provide additional information about the regulation of the genes contained in the geneset.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/geneset_selection.png" alt=""><p class="caption">Geneset Box</p>
</div>
<p>The information provided by the heatmap and volcano plot of each geneset can further be broadened. For this several options are provided through clicking on the cog-wheel symbol in the upper right corner of the page. This opens a sidebar with several additional options. These options include the choice of FDR threshold, the number of genesets displayed in the main graph of the page or a drop-down menu which allows to group/color the displayed heatmap by different factors e.g. the sample id.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/settings.png" alt=""><p class="caption">Different additional possibilities are offered through a sidebar menu</p>
</div>
<p><code>GeneTonic</code> offers a wide range of visualizations of the data in each of the individual panels ranging from birds-eye view plots to detailed plots about specific subsets of the data. However, if some more custom visualizations are required, it is possible to export the objects in use from the app as a SummarizedExperiment object, to be then passed to the <code>iSEE</code> software <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Rue-Albrecht2018" role="doc-biblioref">Rue-Albrecht et al. 2018</a>)</span> for further exploration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the app also offers the possibility to generate a report about genes and genesets of interest. This can be achieved by bookmarking those genes and genesets via the “Bookmark” button found in each panel. The report and SummarizedExperiment object can then be generated in the Bookmark panel by clicking the button “Start the happy hour!” (for the report) or “Export as serialized SummarizedExperiment” (for the SummarizedExperiment)</p>
